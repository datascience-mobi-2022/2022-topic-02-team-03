abstract = {Abstract Principal component analysis (PCA) is a multivariate technique that analyzes a data table in which observations are described by several inter-correlated quantitative dependent variables. Its goal is to extract the important information from the table, to represent it as a set of new orthogonal variables called principal components, and to display the pattern of similarity of the observations and of the variables as points in maps. The quality of the PCA model can be evaluated using cross-validation techniques such as the bootstrap and the jackknife. PCA can be generalized as correspondence analysis (CA) in order to handle qualitative variables and as multiple factor analysis (MFA) in order to handle heterogeneous sets of variables. Mathematically, PCA depends upon the eigen-decomposition of positive semi-definite matrices and upon the singular value decomposition (SVD) of rectangular matrices.

    abstract = { UMAP provides an additional method to visualize microbiome data. The method is extensible to any beta diversity metric used with PCoA, and our results demonstrate that UMAP can indeed improve visualization quality and correspondence with biological and technical variables of interest. Microbiome data are sparse and high dimensional, so effective visualization of these data requires dimensionality reduction. To date, the most commonly used method for dimensionality reduction in the microbiome is calculation of between-sample microbial differences (beta diversity), followed by principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is an alternative method that can reduce the dimensionality of beta diversity distance matrices. Here, we demonstrate the benefits and limitations of using UMAP for dimensionality reduction on microbiome data. Using real data, we demonstrate that UMAP can improve the representation of clusters, especially when the clusters are composed of multiple subgroups. Additionally, we show that UMAP provides improved correlation of biological variation along a gradient with a reduced number of coordinates of the resulting embedding. Finally, we provide parameter recommendations that emphasize the preservation of global geometry. We therefore conclude that UMAP should be routinely used as a complementary visualization method for microbiome beta diversity studies. IMPORTANCE UMAP provides an additional method to visualize microbiome data. The method is extensible to any beta diversity metric used with PCoA, and our results demonstrate that UMAP can indeed improve visualization quality and correspondence with biological and technical variables of interest. The software to perform this analysis is available under an open-source license and can be obtained at https://github.com/knightlab-analyses/umap-microbiome-benchmarking; additionally, we have provided a QIIME 2 plugin for UMAP at https://github.com/biocore/q2-umap. }

abstract = {The analysis of community structure in studies of freshwater ecology often requires the application of dimensionality reduction to process multivariate data. A high number of dimensions (number of taxa/environmental parameters × number of samples), nonlinear relationships, outliers, and high variability usually hinder the visualization and interpretation of multivariate datasets. Here, we proposed a new statistical design using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), and community partitioning using Louvain algorithms, to ordinate and classify the structure of aquatic biota in two-dimensional space. We present this approach with a demonstration of five previously published datasets for diatoms, macrophytes, chironomids (larval and subfossil), and fish. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Ward's clustering were also used to assess the comparability of the UMAP approach compared to traditional approaches for ordination and classification. The ordination of sampling sites in 2-dimensional space showed a much denser, and easier to interpret, grouping using the UMAP approach in comparison to PCA. The classification of community structure using the Louvain algorithm in UMAP ordinal space showed a high classification strength for data with a high number of dimensions than the cluster patterns obtained with the use of a Ward's algorithm in PCA. Environmental gradients, presented via heat maps, were overlayed with the ordination patterns of aquatic communities, confirming that the ordinations obtained by UMAP were ecologically meaningful. This is the first study that has applied a UMAP approach with classification using Louvain algorithms on ecological datasets. We show that the performance of local and global structures, as well as the number of clusters determined by the algorithm, make this approach more powerful than traditional approaches.}

abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.}}

abstract = {This study assesses the potential of Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) as an alternative tool to t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for the reduction and visualization of visible spectral images of works of art. We investigate the influence of UMAP parameters—such as, correlation distance, minimum embedding distance, as well as number of embedding neighbors— on the reduction and visualization of spectral images collected from Poèmes Barbares (1896), a major work by the French artist Paul Gauguin in the collection of the Harvard Art Museums. The use of a cosine distance metric and number of neighbors equal to 10 preserves both the local and global structure of the Gauguin dataset in a reduced two-dimensional embedding space thus yielding simple and clear groupings of the pigments used by the artist. The centroids of these groups were identified by locating the densest regions within the UMAP embedding through a 2D histogram peak finding algorithm. These centroids were subsequently fit to the dataset by non-negative least square thus forming maps of pigments distributed across the work of art studied. All findings were correlated to macro XRF imaging analyses carried out on the same painting. The described procedure for reduction and visualization of spectral images of a work of art is quick, easy to implement, and the software is opensource thus promising an improved strategy for interrogating reflectance images from complex works of art.}
